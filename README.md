# Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture is a sequence who's positive integer, n, always reaches one.  The sequence starts with the integer, and subsequent terms in the sequence depend on whether the number is even or odd. If the number is even, the next term is half the previous term (n/2 when n mod 2 = 0).  If the number is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1 (3n + 1 when n mod 2 = 1).  Eventually, the sequence will reach 1 after a series of steps. 

The markdown project contains Python code for Collatz Conjecture, showing each term in the sequence and also includes how many steps it took to reach one.
